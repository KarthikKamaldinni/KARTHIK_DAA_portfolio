# ABOUT : POLLUTION
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/537d866c-f2a6-4238-8148-b7df362e08da)


Pollution refers to the introduction of harmful substances or contaminants into the environment, resulting in adverse effects on ecosystems, human health, and the planet. These substances can be natural (e.g., volcanic ash) or human-made (e.g., industrial waste), and they disrupt the natural balance of air, water, soil, and other elements of the environment.

**Project Overview**
- A brief description of the project, explaining its focus on addressing multiple types of pollution and their impact on the environment.

**Goal**
- Highlight the project's purpose, such as raising awareness, providing solutions, or offering a data-driven analysis of pollution's effects.

**Features**
- List the main functionalities of the project, such as data visualization, prediction models, or pollution mitigation strategies.

**Technologies Used**
- Mention the programming languages, libraries, frameworks, or tools used in the project.

**Target Audience**
- Specify who the project is for—researchers, students, policymakers, or environmental activists.

 # ABOUT : ALGORITHEMS USED 

1. **Brute Force**
   - **Bubble Sort and Selection Sort:** For ranking zones based on pollution levels.
   - **Linear Search:** To query specific pollution data by ID or zone.
   - **String Processing:** Handle pollution data or alert messages.

2. **Divide and Conquer**
   - **Binary Search:** Quickly identify if pollution exceeds threshold levels.
   - **Merge Sort and Quick Sort:** Sort zones by pollution levels or other metrics.

3. **Decrease and Conquer**
   - **Insertion Sort:** Maintain sorted lists of pollution records or alerts.

4. **Graph Traversal**
   - **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Analyze pollution spread across zones.
   - **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Find connected zones or paths with specific pollution levels.

5. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
   - Find shortest paths for resource allocation (e.g., air purifiers) in the city.

6. **Kruskal’s/Prim’s Algorithm**
   - Build a minimum spanning tree for efficiently connecting zones with pollution control systems.

7. **Clustering (e.g., K-Means)**
   - Group zones with similar pollution levels for targeted action.

8. **Sliding Window Algorithm**
   - Calculate moving averages of pollution over time for real-time monitoring.

9. **Threshold Detection**
   - Trigger alerts when pollution crosses predefined thresholds (linear or binary search).

10. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
    - Allocate resources optimally to minimize overall pollution impact.
